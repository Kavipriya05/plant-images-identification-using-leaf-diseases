In case of any destruction it leads to great loss. In order to prevent the destruction it is mandatory to identify the diseases accurately. The technique of Image processing is definitely a suitable technique. The system involves the image processing in CNN. The leaf of the crop is taken under examination and image processing filters are applied. A suitable dataset is obtained for the appropriate crop and the image thus obtained is treated for max pooling with approximately 3 layers. Then the treated image is compared and processed with the dataset stored. The pre-processing process is done to compare the diseased part and identify the disease .Some of the diseases are affected by bacteria, virus and fungi. Some of the bacterial diseases are bacterial blight of cotton, crown ball. Some of the fungal diseases are Anthracnose, Black root rot. These types of diseases are identified by separate datasets by analyzing the leaf part of the crop
